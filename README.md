Football Data Analysis – Summary

This project explores football player data to find out where top players come from, how their performance changes with age, and what makes some players more valuable than others. The analysis shows that England, Germany, and Spain produce the most players. Footballers usually get better until around age 30–32, after which their performance slowly declines. Among attacking players, left wingers are the most valuable because they play a key role in creating and scoring goals. A comparison between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo Vieira shows that Messi excels in technical skills like dribbling and passing, while Vieira is stronger physically and better in the air.

Different models were tested to group players based on similar attributes, and Agglomerative Clustering gave the best results. The data was mostly balanced and reliable, which helped ensure accurate findings. Overall, this project helps explain how age, position, and nationality affect a football player’s performance and market value.
